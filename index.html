            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I am currently a student in the <a href="https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/interactive-design-graphic-design">IDD</a> program and I am majoring in graphic design. I like drawing  illustrations and have a keen sense of design which I aim to sharpen in my time here in <a href="https://www.sait.ca/">SAIT.</a> This is my portfolio page for now, but I hope to add more in the future, thanks for stopping by:)</p>

            <h4> My Background</h4>
            <p> I immigrated from the philippines, and have been living here in Canada for 8 years. I graduated highschool in 2023 where I took a quick year off before entering the graphic design program. I have been using digital softwares such as Photoshop for a while now as It is my main software for drawing along with photo editing. I also have a keen understanding in Illustrator along with Premier Pro. I started as a traditional artist with charcoal pencils then slowly transitioned to digital where I spent most of my time. I mainly use procreate for quick works and sketches. </p>
